Format an HTML file
===================

This Tidy utility is intended to be used as a quick shell filter for display a bad formatted HTML like:

    cat index.html | tidy

It does NOT try to correct or modify in any way the original HTML, it just indents the code so you can easily spot the structure.

It also does not try to replace the much more advanced and better utility [HTML Tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/).
